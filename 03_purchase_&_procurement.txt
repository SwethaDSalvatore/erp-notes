In ERPNext, the interface may differ slightly based on versions or specific customizations. If you don't see fields like "Purchase Order" and "From Supplier" directly in the stock entry form, it's likely that these fields are not part of the default Stock Entry form and need to be linked differently. Below, I'll provide an updated step-by-step guide to creating a stock entry for receiving goods against a purchase order:
